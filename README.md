This is just a simple react app to practice on the knowledge gained in studying react.

I have implemented several functionalities including components, states, routing and crud operations in react.

For components and state, they dynamically exist in this app. I have used the useState and useEffect states.

The app has in total three pages which are accessed through routing, where the path of each page is displayed on the tab.

Finally the data is retrieved and persisted in a custom API through the CRUD operations

The frontend part of the app has been deployed to netlify through: https://ujenzi-constructions-ltd.netlify.app/

The backend part of the app has been deployed to heroku through: https://ujenzico-ltd.herokuapp.com/
